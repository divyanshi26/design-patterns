# Documentation of my first encounter with design patterns
I never knew design patterns existed until a friend suggested I watch Mosh Hamedani's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU_1StN5Tkk) before an interview. Although I wasn't asked anything about design patterns, I figured, as a programmer, I could benefit from knowing them. So here, I will put my learnings about design patterns and try to implement them in my favourite languages.
